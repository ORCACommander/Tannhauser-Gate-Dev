  - bugfix: Disposal outlets no longer constantly shoot you out at an incredibly dangerous

      10 brute damage they were at last year, though you can still multitool/emag

      the upper z-level) will now cause you to smash through it and fall to the z-level

      addition to reducing the delay the limp adds.
  - balance: Skeletons and plasmamen can now apply bone gel directly to fractured
      limbs, take no damage from applying this fix, don't need surgical tape, and
      recover 4x as fast as fleshy humans do from these improvised fixes. Shine on,

      slings than before, with surgical tape even outshining gauze.

      of place and we'll do our best to get to them in a timely manner.

      designs to autolathes with a variable that does the same when set FALSE. Energy

      it set FALSE. TL;DR: You can export designs like bluespace cells to autolathes.
      qol: Added a chat feedback when unable to import designs to autolathes.'

      setting that makes the invisible portions of their icons count toward mouse

      layer. Instead, to be easier to click on, they use a component that gives them
      a near-invisible underlay.

      notice a few more examines and error messages for fail cases but otherwise it's
      all the same

      cases when the HFR was unpowered, out of fuel, interacted with other subsystems

      mathematically equivalent normalized equations derived from human-parseable

      which effectively doubled the rate under some conditions.

      pretty decal on the affected part while becoming immune to all future cracking
      conditions, as long as nobody repaired the crack. The initial spill if highly
      pressurized is still the most dangerous, but the HFR will continue to slowly
      leak its contents even under low pressure while cracked. content: The HFR initially
      took damage at unsafe fusion levels with excess mass over 2500-1500 moles, depending
      on temperature. This was later changed to 2700-2589 moles, but in a way that
      looked like it was only meant make the thresholds a few hundred moles more tolerant.
      The range is now 2700-1800 moles.'
  - bugfix: HFR production rate is no longer multiplied by both the fuel consumption
      modifier and the gas production modifier. This means the top tier Hypernoblium/Anti-noblium

      players to make them appear as if they were cultists when examined, without

      construction.
  - bugfix: Smart pipe construction now no longer tries to work around irrelevant
      pipes which are on completely different layers and do not interact with the
      new pipe in any way.
  - bugfix: Smart pipes with less than two allowed directions can no longer be built.
      The pipe would be invisible, but still interact in weird ways.
  - bugfix: 'One tile can no longer have more than one atmospheric component ready
      to connect in the same direction and layer. This prevents the scenario where
      a temperature pump is placed in a manner which looks like it''s going to connect
      to a horizontal bridge pipe, but actually turns the vertical plasma input pipe
      behind it into a manifold, ruptures the connected plasma canister, and sets
      Toxins on fire. qol: Smart pipes are now much, much smarter. During construction,
      if a smart pipe would block placement of a component, it will see if permitted
      connectivity can be reconfigured to make room for other components. This includes
      negotiation with other smart pipes, preferring to create pipe crossings where
      available, or create an opposing corner pipe if not. The RPD can now also reconfigure
      allowed connectivity for existing smart pipes manually. Smart pipes can never
      be reconfigured to have less than two allowed directions, and active connections
      cannot be reconfigured. Automatic reconfiguration will never cause a smart pipe
      to permit connectivity that was not previously permitted.'
  - bugfix: Multi-layer pipe components can trigger smart pipe negotiation where relevant.
  - refactor: Rearranged some atmospherics pipe code. Fewer redundant loops, add and
      use documented and centralized helpers for bit manipulation where sensible.
